Order Management UI: Design Brief

  For UX/UI designers new to the Teligant/Hedfirst platform

  What We Do (The 30-Second Version)

  We're a telehealth platform that lets people get prescription medications online. A patient visits the website, answers health questions,
   and if a doctor approves them, we ship their medication to their door. Many patients also sign up for ongoing subscriptions so they get
  automatic refills.

  Think of it like buying glasses online: you can't just add prescription lenses to your cart and check out. A doctor has to review your
  prescription first. We're the same concept, but for medications.

  Why Our Orders Are Different

  Here's where it gets interesting for you as a designer.

  When a customer checks out on Amazon, they buy three things, they get one order, done. Our world is more complicated because different 
  items in the same cart behave completely differently.

  Imagine a customer's cart contains:
  - A $29 consultation fee (so a doctor will review their request)
  - A $19/month membership (for discounts and perks)
  - A $299/month medication (the prescription they actually want)
  - A free lab kit (to test their blood before starting the medication)

  From the customer's perspective, this is "one order." They clicked checkout once, entered their card once, and expect to see one
  confirmation.

  But behind the scenes, each of those four items has a completely different life:

  | Item             | When We Charge              | What Happens Next                 |
  |------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Consultation fee | Right now                   | Done. One-time charge.            |
  | Membership       | Right now, then every month | Recurring subscription begins     |
  | Medication       | Only if the doctor approves | Card is saved but not charged yet |
  | Lab kit          | Right now (it's free)       | Ships immediately                 |

  So one checkout creates four separate "mini-orders" that we track independently. We call these child orders or sub-orders, and they all
  live under one parent order (the thing the customer sees as "their order").

  The Core Design Challenge

  How do we show staff a list of orders that's simple enough to scan quickly, but detailed enough to manage each item's unique status and 
  actions?

  A single order might have:
  - One item that's complete
  - One item waiting for a doctor
  - One item with a failed payment
  - One item that's shipping

  The parent order isn't really "complete" or "pending" — it's a mix. Staff need to see the overall picture at a glance, but also drill
  into specifics without losing context.

  The People Using This Interface

  Store Administrators (Primary Users)

  These are the day-to-day operators. They need to:
  - See which orders need attention (doctor review, payment failures, shipping issues)
  - Quickly find a specific customer's order when they call in
  - Take actions like refunding, pausing subscriptions, or resending shipments
  - Understand the full picture of what a customer purchased

  Their pain points today:
  - Too many clicks to see what's actually going on with an order
  - Hard to tell at a glance which orders are stuck and why
  - Subscription management is scattered across multiple screens

  Providers (Doctors)

  Doctors only care about one thing: prescription items waiting for their review. They need to:
  - See the patient's health questionnaire answers
  - Review any lab results
  - Approve or deny the prescription
  - Add clinical notes

  They don't need to see the membership, consultation fee, or lab kit details — that's noise for them.

  Patients (Self-Service Portal)

  Patients see a simplified view of "their orders." They want to:
  - Know if their prescription was approved
  - Track their shipment
  - See when their next subscription charge is coming
  - Pause or cancel recurring items

  Key Concepts to Internalize

  1. Parent vs. Child Orders

  Every checkout creates one parent order (HF-1234) containing one or more child orders. The parent is the container; the children are the
  actual items with their own statuses and lifecycles.

  Design implication: The list view shows parents. Expanding a row reveals children.

  2. Immediate vs. Deferred Payment

  Some items charge immediately (consultation, membership, lab kit). Prescriptions are different — we save the card but don't charge until
  a doctor approves. If the doctor denies, we never charge at all.

  Design implication: A prescription child order might show "Payment pending approval" while other children in the same order show "Paid."

  3. One-Time vs. Subscription

  Some items are buy-once-done. Others create ongoing subscriptions with their own billing cycles. A single order might have both.

  Design implication: Subscription items need to show next billing date and offer pause/cancel actions. One-time items don't.

  4. The -7 Day Rule

  For medication subscriptions, we charge for refills 7 days before the patient would run out. A "30-day supply" actually bills on day 23.
  This prevents gaps in treatment while shipping is in transit.

  Design implication: When showing "next refill date," be precise. Don't confuse staff or patients about when charges happen.

  5. Status Inheritance

  The parent order's status is derived from its children. If any child is awaiting review, the parent shows "Awaiting Review." If
  everything is complete, the parent shows "Complete." Mixed states show "Partial."

  Design implication: You'll need clear visual hierarchy. Parent status is the headline; child statuses are the details.

  What Success Looks Like

  A staff member should be able to:

  1. Scan the order list and immediately spot which orders need attention (stuck reviews, failed payments, shipping problems)
  2. Understand an order's full story by expanding one row — not navigating to a separate page
  3. Take action on any item without hunting through menus (pause this subscription, refund that consultation, approve this prescription)
  4. Answer a customer's phone call by searching their name and seeing everything they've ever ordered, with current statuses, in seconds

  | order-system-logic.md          | Technical deep-dive on how orders work, all the statuses, billing cycles, and edge cases |
  | purchase-scenarios-catalog.pdf | Every possible purchase scenario documented with flowcharts                              |
  | purchase-scenarios-schema.json | Machine-readable version of the scenarios (useful for test cases)                        |

  Start with this brief, then review the diagrams, then dive into the technical docs as needed for edge cases.

  Questions to Keep in Mind

  As you explore the documents and start designing:

  - How do we make the parent row informative enough that staff don't need to expand every single order?
  - What's the right visual treatment for "this item is waiting on something external" (doctor review, lab results, payment retry)?
  - How do we handle the provider view, which is essentially a filtered version of the same data?
  - Should subscription actions (pause, cancel) be prominent or tucked away to prevent accidents?
  - How do we communicate the -7 day refill timing without confusing patients who expect "30-day" to mean 30 days?

  Welcome to the project. The complexity is real, but so is the opportunity to make something that genuinely helps people manage a tricky
  workflow. Happy to walk through any of this in more detail.
