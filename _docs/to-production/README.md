# To Production

This folder contains session handoff documents generated by the **Mockup Claude** (this project) to share insights with the Production Claude.

## Purpose

These documents inform the Production Claude about:

- UI patterns and decisions made during mockup development
- Data shape requirements discovered through UI exploration
- Architecture decisions that should influence backend design
- Questions that need production context to answer

## How to Use

1. At the end of significant mockup sessions, ask: "Generate a handoff document for the production project"
2. Review and save to this folder
3. Copy to `teligant-product/_docs/mockup-insights/` for Production Claude to access
