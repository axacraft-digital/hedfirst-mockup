The case FOR you doing this:

  1. You understand the domain better than your developers. They're implementing your mental model. Why not just... implement it yourself?
  2. AI-assisted development has genuinely changed the equation. The bottleneck used to be "writing code." Now it's "knowing what to
  build." You have the second part. Claude can help with the first.
  3. Your V1 has significant technical debt. 185 endpoints with tenant isolation gaps. Missing audit logging. Unencrypted PHI. A fresh
  build with modern patterns might be faster than fixing V1.
  4. Modern infrastructure is genuinely simpler. Supabase + Vercel + Clerk is not the same as "spinning up servers." It's closer to
  "configuring a platform."
  5. You're already doing the hardest part. The mockup work, data modeling, architectural decisions — that's 60% of the work. The
  "implementation" part is increasingly automatable.

  The case AGAINST (or at least, cautions):

  1. Production is unforgiving about edge cases. Your mockup doesn't need to handle payment webhook retries at 3 AM. Production does.
  2. HIPAA liability is real. If there's a PHI breach because of a bug you wrote, that's on you. With a team, at least there's shared
  accountability and review.
  3. Your time has opportunity cost. Is writing code the highest-value use of your time? Or is it directing strategy, sales, partnerships?
  4. Maintenance is forever. Building is fun. Maintaining is not. Are you signing up for on-call?
  5. Your developers aren't slow because they're incompetent. They're slow because they're careful, they're handling edge cases, they're
  thinking about security. Some of that "slowness" is actually diligence.

  What I'd actually recommend

  Given everything I know about your situation:

  Option A: Hybrid approach (most pragmatic)

  1. You build V2's frontend and data model — You're already doing this. Keep going. Your mockups become the real UI.
  2. Use Supabase for the database layer — Postgres, real-time, Row Level Security. HIPAA BAA available on Pro tier.
  3. Keep one senior developer for the hard integrations — PayTheory, pharmacy, the webhook/payment complexity. Not because you can't learn
   it, but because it's the highest-risk area.
  4. Bring your other developer along — Teach them to work WITH AI. If they can't adapt, that's a different conversation.

  Option B: Full rebuild yourself (viable but intensive)

  1. Start with a single portal — Patient portal is simplest. No provider approvals, no admin complexity.
  2. Use Supabase + Next.js + your mockup code — You're 70% there already.
  3. Stub the integrations initially — Build the order system, but stub PayTheory and pharmacy. Add real integrations incrementally.
  4. Get a security review before going live — Have someone audit your HIPAA controls. This is non-negotiable for healthcare.

  What I would NOT recommend:

  - Don't try to maintain V1 AND build V2 simultaneously. You'll do both poorly.
  - Don't skip the HIPAA controls because they're "boring." That's where the real liability is.
  - Don't assume AI can replace ALL developer judgment. It can't handle ambiguity, security edge cases, or "this feels wrong" intuition as
  well as an experienced human.

  The bottom line

  You asked for my honest opinion, so here it is:

  You could build a production system. You have the architectural understanding, the domain knowledge, and access to tools that genuinely
  lower the barrier. You're not a business person with delusions of technical grandeur — you're someone who's been in this industry for 25
  years and understands what you're looking at.

  The question is whether you should. That depends on:
  - Your time and where it creates the most value
  - Your appetite for being on-call for production issues
  - Whether you want to manage a system or direct a company

  If I were in your position, I'd probably do Option A — take ownership of the frontend and data model (where your speed advantage is
  highest), and keep one sharp developer for the integration complexity and production firefighting.

  But I also wouldn't dismiss Option B. You're closer to being able to do it than you might think, and your current team's resistance to AI
   tooling is a real problem that isn't going away.
