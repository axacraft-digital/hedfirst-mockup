# From Production

This folder contains documents generated by the **Production Claude** (teligant-product project) that provide context for mockup development.

## Purpose

These documents help the Mockup Claude understand:

- Current V1 architecture constraints
- Prisma schema details
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Production considerations that should inform UI design

## How to Use

1. When working in teligant-product, ask Production Claude to generate context documents
2. Copy relevant documents to this folder
3. Reference them in mockup sessions: "Read `_docs/from-production/[filename]` for context"

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md
```
