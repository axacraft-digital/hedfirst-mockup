      "historyOfPresentIllness": "Jacob Henderson is a 29-year-old male seeking CJC 1295 1.2mg + Ipamorelin 2mg monthly for health optimization. This is his first experience with peptide therapy. His primary health goals include muscle growth and recovery, improved sleep quality, injury recovery and healing, athletic performance enhancement, enhanced cognitive function and focus, increased energy and vitality, anti-aging and longevity, and stress management and mood improvement.\n\nPatient reports being very active and working out daily, exercising 4-5 times per week. He states he has had some minor overuse issues in the past from training, so recovery and injury prevention are important to him. He reports no major medical conditions but wants to support his body as he continues to train consistently. His primary motivation for considering peptide therapy is general health optimization and wellness. Patient is comfortable with self-administering subcutaneous injections but will need education on proper technique.",
