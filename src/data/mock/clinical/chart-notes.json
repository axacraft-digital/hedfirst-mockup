Patient reports decreased energy, difficulty recovering from workouts, reduced muscle mass despite consistent training, and mild fatigue. He exercises 4-5 times per week and maintains a healthy diet but has noticed declining performance over the past 6 months.\n\nPatient reports being very active and working out regularly. He states he has had some difficulty maintaining strength gains and notices prolonged recovery time between training sessions. His primary motivation for considering TRT is to restore energy levels, improve recovery, and optimize his training outcomes. Patient is comfortable with self-administering intramuscular injections but will need education on proper technique.",
